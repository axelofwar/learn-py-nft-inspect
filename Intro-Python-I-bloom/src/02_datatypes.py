"""
Python is a strongly-typed language under the hood, which means
that the types of values matter, especially when we're trying
to perform operations on them.

Note that if you try running the following code without making any
changes, you'll get a TypeError saying you can't perform an operation
on a string and an integer.
"""

"""
When we are creating variables, we don't need to declare the type of
the variable. Python will infer the type of the variable based on the
value we assign to it.

In the example below, we are creating a variable called "x" and
assigning it the value of 5. Python will infer that x is an integer
because we assigned it an integer value.

We then create another variable called "y" and assign it the
value of "7". Python will infer that y is a string because we
assigned it a string value by putting the quotations around it.

"""

x = 5
y = "7"

# Write a print statement that combines x + y into the integer value 12

# YOUR CODE HERE


# Write a print statement that combines x + y into the string value 57
