A print statement is a way to output data to the terminal.

The data being output is called an argument.
Arguments are passed into functions.
Functions are reusable blocks of code that perform a specific task.
In this case, the print function outputs data to the terminal.

print takes in one argument, which is the data to be output.
in this case, the argument is the string "Hello, world!"
