    "One of the cool features in jupyter is that we can include markdown within our python code to make formatting comments and discussion much nicer. Instead of using block comments like the orange text in previous lessons (which leaves ugly output sometimes if you run the cell) - we can use markdown - which you're familiar with if you use discord messages! Jupyter notebooks also have runnable cells that package most of your imports and make runnign the code easier when shared. There are two advantage over other IDEs that make it more beginner friendly (although vs code also has jupyter extensions that I'm using to make this). Running a markdown block will also not affect your cell run count.\n"
